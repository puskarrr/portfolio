            <p>I was born and raised in Nepal in a humble and supportive family that always emphasized the value of education, hard work, and perseverance. Growing up, I was naturally curious and enjoyed exploring the world around me, often fascinated by maps, geography, and technology. This curiosity gradually shaped my interest in spatial sciences and geospatial technology.

            My early education took place at G.H.P. Secondary School, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and problem-solving. As a child, I was always eager to learn new things, whether it was understanding how locations were mapped or exploring the relationship between land and technology. This passion led me to pursue Geomatics Engineering at Kathmandu University, where I am currently in my final year.
                
            Academically, I have always been dedicated to learning and self-improvement, despite facing financial challenges. I have actively engaged in projects related to GIS, remote sensing, surveying, and WebGIS development, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional land surveying methods and modern technological advancements. My goal is to develop efficient, data-driven, and scalable GIS solutions that can have real-world applications in fields like disaster management, urban planning, and land administration.
            <br><br>  
            Beyond my studies, I am deeply passionate about continuous learning, technology, and innovation. I enjoy exploring new tools, programming, and web development, particularly focusing on GIS Web Development and PostgreSQL. My vision is to contribute meaningfully to the geospatial industry, leveraging my skills to create smarter and more sustainable solutions for the future.
                
            In addition to academics, I have held leadership roles, such as serving as Joint Secretary of my departmental club, where I developed skills in teamwork, event management, and collaboration. I am also deeply committed to personal growth, always seeking opportunities to learn, adapt, and innovate.
                
            As I move forward, I remain focused on expanding my expertise, gaining hands-on experience, and making a positive impact in the geospatial field. With dedication, persistence, and a passion for geospatial science, I aspire to build a career that combines technology, data, and spatial intelligence to solve real-world problems.</p>
